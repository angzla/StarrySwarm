# StarrySwarm
This work is an art project that explores how different swarm algorithms, algorithms based off of collective intelligent systems in nature, can make art from inputted audio. I use Processing to visualize KANTS, PSO, and BOIDS and compare the outputs based on visual variability for different music genres and sounds. In my thesis linked [here](url), I discuss how StarrySwarm, my implementation of BOIDS, was the most dynamic across movement and color and responsive to changes in sound.

## HOW TO RUN LOCALLY
1. From Github, download and open app package according to operating system
2. If on MacOS, open terminal
- Type xattr -cr \path\to\app
4. Download necessary packages, usually java
5. Allow sound access 

## HOW TO EDIT CODE 
1. Download Processing 4.3.4 [https://processing.org/download](https://processing.org/download)
2. Import sound library
3. Copy Code or Download Code from Github for selected algorithm, paste or open in processing
- BOIDS_final is the final version of StarrySwarm 
- PSO_final is the final version of PSO
- KANTS_color is the final version of KANTS
4. Edit in Java 
5. Allow access to computer output
6. Play to run
